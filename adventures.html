         <h4>Horse riding</h4>
         <p>
          Horseback riding in the stunning Durmitor offers an unparalleled experience, immersing riders in nature's splendor...
         </p>
           <a href="#" class="btn service-btn" data-title="Horse riding" data-text="1. The hour-long tour starts from our ranch and goes around a small part of the Lake Highlands. The whole time we are accompanied by the view of the Durmitor massif. We recommend it to families with small children or those who are unsure or afraid. The tour costs €25 per person.
           2. Tour that lasts 2 hours: During the tour, we cross a large part of the Lake Plateau, pass through a mini canyon and climb to the viewpoint on the hill. Depending on the time of year, we may come across a periodic lake that appears in the spring from melting snow or when there are heavy rains. When there is no lake, the meadow that remains behind it is ideal for a little faster riding. The tour is circular and costs €50 per person.
           3. The tour, which lasts a little over 3 hours, crosses the entire Jezerska plateau and reaches Riblje and Vražje lakes. At Devil's Lake, we take a short break for rest and photography, after which we continue the tour and return to our ranch. The view of the Durmitor massif accompanies us all the time. This tour costs €70 per person.
           
           
           Do not miss the opportunity to experience Durmitor in a completely different way, in the silence of nature and in the company of noble horses. Horseback riding on Durmitor is not just an activity, but an experience that will remain in your memory for a lifetime.">Read More</a>
